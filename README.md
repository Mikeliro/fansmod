This is minecraft forge modification adding fans.
### Fan types
![Image of all fans](./screenshots/up.png)\
Currently there are iron, gold, redstone, diamond and emerald fans (each faster than its predecessor).
As you can see on the image, iron fan is weaker than gravity. If entity stands on two fans at once, then their force adds up.
Redstone fan needs redstone signal to turn on. Others are always active.
