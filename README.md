### Basic fans
Currently there are iron, gold, diamond and emerald fans (each faster than its predecessor).
Iron fan is weaker than gravity. If entity stands on two fans at once, then their force adds up.

### Redstone fan
Redstone fan needs redstone signal to turn on. Others are always active.

### Configurable fan
Range of this fan can be configured by right clicking on it (0 blocks - 15 blocks).
